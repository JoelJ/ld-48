#LD-48 #48!

This is my first LD Jam. The theme is "Deeper and Deeper".

My plan was to make a Dungeon Crawler. 
Much like the old [Castle of the Winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_of_the_Winds) series.
The idea being, each level takes you "deeper" into ... the castle thing.
Unfortunately, I only have the first 30 of the 48 hours to compete.
So I got as much as I could. Hopefully the vision of the game is there. :)
Even if it's not I had a lot of fun doing this.

## How to Play

WASD / Arrows to move. Try to get to the stairs. 
Walk into enemies to attack them. Careful, they attack back if you're next to them!

# Background / Story

When my daughter was young she enjoyed when the "Tickle Monster" came to play.
The Tickle Monster is my hand that walks on two fingers. 
And of course, the Tickle Monster loves tickling her. :)

Now that's she's a little older... she still loves when the Tickle Monster comes to play.
So I made the theme of the character in honor of her and the games we play.

The main character is a four fingered glove.
It's name is "Tickle Monster", if you hadn't guessed already.

The enemy is a Pepper. Why a Pepper? Because I thought it would be easy
to draw a banana. Instead I drew what looked more like a chili pepper.
So I colored it red and called it good.

I've been wanting to make a game where the animations / gameplay syncs up
with the beat of the music. I decided to use this as an excuse to do so.
While I'm not sure the way I did it is the "best" way to do it, 
I'm quite happy with how it turned out.

## Credits

- All sprites were hand drawn by me using The Gimp.
- All sounds/music were generated using the amazing tool: [sfxr](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html)
- The amazing [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) project! I used v3.3 for this project.

## TODO / What I would do if I built this game with more time to spare

- Make the beat actually mean something. Similar to Crypt of the Necrodancer / Cadence of Hyrule.
- Traditional RPG elements (EXP, Level up system, equipment).
  I played with this a bit in the Stats object. I intended it to work
  where you could wrap all your equipment and player stats into an
  IStats instance and have the battle system 'just work'. But instead
  I have a have thought out system that masquerades as something more than
  it is. But it works for what I needed :P
- More enemies, bosses, etc.
- Bigger levels.
- Generated maps.
- More on-theme elements... maybe the baddies should've been feet...
